    Hi Abbas,
    <br /><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were glad to meet you and would like propose a free trial run for the Ubrand app for upto a month. 
        We are getting a huge traction in Hyderabad as well as good responses. 
        We hope that you will love the app.
        <br /><br />
<b style="color:#009900;">About Ubrand</b>:<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ubrand aims to provide solutions to bring brands and consumers closer to each other.
These solutions can be as simple as a “tap what you like” or “hot-or-not” game. 
We tried to apply gamification to increase interaction between users and brands while they are at the billing counter.
        <br /><br />
After this product won Startup Weekend Hyderabad, it went on to become a finalist (Top-14) in Global Startup Weekend, San Fransisco. The only Indian team to reach till there.
We also let people play this game in some famous malls and all of them simply loved the game. 
        <br /><br />
The most interesting thing is, in no more than 30 secs per customer, this game collects <b style="color:#000000;">96000 opinions</b> about different products <b style="color:#000000;">in just one month</b> of use, assuming it is installed in just 10 stores and only 20 customers per day use it per day. This data can be useful to brands for variety of purposes like forecasting their sales, inventory management, most importantly which products consumers like or don’t like, other than the ones they have already purchased. 
        <br /><br />
At the same time, this simple game exposes 16 different products in a matter of just 30 seconds to a consumer while he/she is playing it.
